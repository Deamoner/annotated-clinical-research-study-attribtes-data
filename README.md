# Annotated Clinical Research Study Attributes

This repo should supply the data for training of models to find the clinical trial attribute sentences.

Also included in this repo are the resulting models from the original training with additional feature vectors
from the spacy library. This type of training will be added in and the training files should be included in this repo.

Please use the NLP Colab or Jupyter Notebook to see how it all works.
